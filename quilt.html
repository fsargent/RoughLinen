    <p>The excitement of making a quilt the proper way, from scraps, is the balance between accuracy and ingenuity. The aim is to create beauty of expression with economy – even frugality – of means. </p>
    <p>I was inspired by the patterns and creativity of Amish and Gees Bend Quilt makers.</p>
    <p>A lot of work goes into making these quilts &ndash; no two are ever the same.</p>
    <p>The charm of making these quilts is the fine mix of putting it together and the simplicity of the material.</p>
    <p>It really please me to be making something using scraps which would be otherwise thrown away &ndash; and by dint of skill and effort to make something beautiful, something collectable.</p>
    <p>Apart from these two quilts and a third which is underway, I plan to make any other quilts on demand &ndash; the size and colors you want &ndash; assuming, of course I have the linen scraps. </p>
    <p>So I am making these future quilts as custom quilts &ndash; contact me at tricia@roughlinen.com or by phone (415) 235 6231 and tell me what you would like, both size and color way &ndash; the squares are 20” &ndash; so the size needs to be in 20” increments, I can make any size.</p></p>
