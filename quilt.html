    <p>The excitement of making a quilt the proper way, from scraps, is the balance between accuracy and ingenuity. The aim is to create beauty of expression with economy &ndash; even frugality &ndash; of means. </p>
    <p>I was inspired by the patterns and creativity of Amish and Gees Bend Quilt makers.</p>
    <p>A lot of work goes into making these quilts &ndash; no two are ever the same. Their charm comes from their irregularity, emerging naturally from availability of fabric, the ingenuity of putting it together and the simplicity of the material.</p>
    <p>It really please me to be making something using scraps which would be otherwise thrown away &ndash; and by dint of skill and effort to make something beautiful, something collectable.</p>
    <p>Apart from these two colorways and a third which is nearly finished, I plan to make any other quilts on demand &ndash; the size and colors you want &ndash; assuming, of course I have the linen scraps. </p>
    <p>So I am making these future quilts as custom quilts &ndash; contact me at <a mailto:"tricia@roughlinen.com">tricia@roughlinen.com</a> or by phone <a href="tel:+14152356231">(415) 235 6231</a> and tell me what you would like, both size and color &ndash; I can make any size.</p>
