                    <p class="clearBoth">The signature Orkney duvet cover, made from the linen that started it all. This was my first product - I sleep under it every night.</p>
                    <p> Elemental ... timeless, plain, natural linen woven on traditional single-width looms, three pieces joined with with minimum seams.</p>
                    <p>The fabric begins with its own clean, crisp texture, softening with wear and washing to a silvery sheen.</p>
                    <p> I added white, black, and now charcoal, and now indigo. The plainest of buttons, natural coconut shell or white, and black buttons for black and indigo covers. Invisible zippers (we call it 'the Architect's Version') for minimalists.</p>
                    <p>A duvet cover should fit the infill snugly, up to 6" smaller all round to ensure that it doesn't shift. I have even put a king infill into a queen cover, with cosy results.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also make duvet covers in <a href="rough-linen-st-barts-duvet-cover.html">St Barts</a> and <a href="rough-linen-smooth-duvet-cover.html">Smooth</a> linen.</p>

            <p>Richard Ostell's Rough Linen Orkney duvet cover and bedskirt– I had forgotten how much I loved linen, but <strong><a href="http://richardostell.com/">Richard Ostell</a></strong>, a respected fashion and home designer, reminded me. The shots were from his home in Westchester County, N.Y. Rough woven linens graced his tables, windows and bed like a pure sigh of relief.
                <br> I got him on the phone.
                <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling to talk about our mutual love of linen,&rdquo; I said, breaking Rule No. 1 in journalism: Never show your bias.
                <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fan of superfluous detail,&rdquo; he said, in a British accent that oozed refinement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather have something plain. Linen is honest, simple, humble, durable and has an element of having been touched by human hands.&rdquo;
                <br> The former creative director for Liz Claiborne, Ostell now has his own furniture and product design company. His work, whether in fashion or furnishings, reflects style that doesn&rsquo;t scream. His home whispers, &ldquo;I am here to comfort, not impress.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a mantra more homes should adopt.
                <br> &ldquo;Linen is this great-looking fabric, so why don&rsquo;t we use it more?&rdquo; I ask.
                <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m puzzled by that, as well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Possibly because it&rsquo;s naturally rumpled look gave it a reputation for being too casual. It got pigeonholed, but it can be very sophisticated. I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand what they can do with it.&rdquo;
                <br> &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the ironing,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;All that pressing and starching. Who has time?&rdquo;
                <br> &ldquo;I never iron linen,&rdquo; he says.
                <br> &ldquo;Ever?&rdquo;
                <br> &ldquo;It defeats the point of it. The rumpled look is part of its beauty. I love it right when it comes out of the dryer fluffy. I don&rsquo;t think people should think it looks messy. It should be left as it is." – from <strong>Marni Jameson</strong>'s syndicated column</p>
            <img src="claire-1-960.jpg" class="full-width" alt="">
            <p><em>"It is hard to express and even harder to believe that there is still some snow on the ground on April 11th along the shores of Lake Michigan. On the bright side, we can still snuggle under our winter weight comforter nicely enrobed by the Orkney natural duvet."</em> – <strong>Claire</strong></p>
            <div class="leftColumn">
                <p><em>"Sometimes you take a chance on something, and it works out incredibly well. This is one of those things. I bought the Orkney duvet cover and 2 slips (to check out whether I'd want sheets), and I love them. Just freaking love them. I get in bed and run my hands over the cover and think, 'You did a good thing here.'
<br>
The infill fits perfectly and stays in place, even without securing it with clips or ties. It softens the room (mainly deep grays and steel and blacks). Needless to say, just a week after it arrived, I've ordered more slips and sheets.
<br>
I am thrilled to get into bed and loath to leave it, and it's become a dating criterion (I would cut loose a potential partner before I cut loose this linen)."</em> – <strong>Hampton H.</strong> </p>

                <br>
                <p><em>"I bought the duvet cover along with a sheet and two pillow slips. I don't usually splurge on things like bedclothes, but I am so glad that when I finally did, I did on these!

        I received my duvet cover and pillow slips this afternoon. I washed them and dried them by air (it was a warm evening) and have been lounging in them tonight. They are absolutely wonderful.<br> 
        I fell in love with linen sheets on a voyage through in Sicily last year.They were used in many of my small hotels and I was so surprised how much more I enjoyed sleeping in linen over plain cotton.<br>
        I managed to find a queen fitted sheet and two pillow cases in Italy, but no duvet cover or shams. So thank you for bringing me a little bit of Sicily here in SF! Now my bed is completely in linen and I am plum pleased. Thanks so much!<br>

What's great, is how forgiving Rough Linen is; the color along with the texture was no less for wear.<br>

Plus, I have a husband whom I have to strategically place anything of beauty as he's like a bull in a china shop - not with this duvet cover, thank you for making such a beautiful piece of art that I get to use and enjoy with him.<br>

Your crafstmanship and artistic abilities put FUN into Functional - this is one keepsake that I'll get to enjoy in my daily life and handdown after I'm gone (not like damn Waterford that just sits, or gets used once a year; maybe I should start using it daily, hummm...<br>

I'd love to slip cover my world with your Rough Linen!<br>

Thanks again,"</em> – <strong>Deb</strong></p>
