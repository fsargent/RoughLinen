<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My husband and I just built a home for ourselves and our four children. I'd been stashing away money to purchase a larger bed and bedding once we moved in, as we were previously sleeping in a double sized bed. We have been so delighted with the comfort of our new bed and the linen sheets. We choose the smooth white linen for the sheet and the cream orkney for the duvet cover and bolsters. The bolsters make reading in bed so much more comfortable.
    <br> Thank you for your part in making my dream bedroom a reality!
