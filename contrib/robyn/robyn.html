I found you on the net and read all your reviews&hellip;I waited several days then ordered on Wednesday and I had my linens on Friday&hellip; and I live in Birmingham, Alabama.  I thought the customer service was great, but the linens I put on the bed are even better.  My husband and I love these wonderful sheets. So I thought I would surprise him&hellip;and boy was he.
</p><p>The linens are just beautiful and just what I was hoping for. Not too much but just perfect&hellip;
</p><p>I have looked for linens with the 'right look'  for ever and did not find, until now, what I was looking for&hellip;Shall I  say I want more!  The color, texture, and overall how they feel will be a good night make.

</p><p>We have a little cottage, surrounded by gardens, just outside of Philadelphia. For a recent bedroom makeover we decided to go with linen sheets, that's how I luckily found Rough Linen. The bed bundle, consisting of smooth white sheets and pillow slips as well as duvet cover and pillow shams in Orkney natural, is pure luxury! The fabric is beautiful, the workmanship is top notch and the whole look is exquisite. Just seeing the bed now fills me with a deep sense of calm and tranquility. Not to mention, once nestled in the bedding, one is transported to the dreamiest night's sleep ever. Next up I hope to purchase the pinafore and napkins as I do a lot of cooking and baking (and eating) for my blog Almacucina. Tricia, thank you from the bottom of my heart for having the integrity and creativity to bring us these wonderful, life enhancing, old world linens.
