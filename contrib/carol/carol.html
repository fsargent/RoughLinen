<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been coveting your Rough Linen since I first saw the website almost 2 years ago.  At that time, we had just purchased an older 1979 home here in Fort McMurray, Alberta (Canada’s Oil Sands) and would being renovating it to make it our own.  I knew the Myriad curtains would be perfect for the master bedroom …. and, (I like being right!)  Wow.  They look AMAZING!  I love walking into the room, and see them as the icing on the cake -made even better when the window is open and they billow out with the breeze.  I am at peace and I catch myself smiling.  I am a lover of the unique, and items handmade with love.  Your wonderful linens are both. We also have a vacation home in the Dominican Republic…..guess what will be going there ;-) ~ Carol
