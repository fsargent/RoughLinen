Quintessential Santa Barbara Lifestyle at its finest makes it hard to let go of this one… We loved our hot rolled steel lined kitchen cubbies, vintage lumber shelves, and the single level living this hacienda offers.  Crisp white chalky walls and Turkish plaster in the showers….no tile. The only thing we love more than our Rough Linen fabric is the way we smocked the top of it on the curtains that hang from our hand-hammered iron rods offering privacy for our dry goods in the pantry…
