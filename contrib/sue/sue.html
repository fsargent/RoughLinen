I have a smallish house in a beautiful leafy neighborhood in Chicago.  It's just the right size for me.  I like beautiful, interesting things that tell a story and I like to display treasures I've brought back from my travels.  My yard is a place I go to think, putter, work out problems and work up a sweat!  And after all of that, it's the best place to take a drink and to be.  Rough Linen is a very new addition to my home.  It fits right in to the feeling I want people to get when they visit--relaxing, beautiful, interesting.  Now that I've lived with the summer bed and the dish towel for about a month, I am dreaming about the bolsters and a linen table cloth for my next purchases.  Rough Linen is a luxury that whispers instead of shouts. ~ Sue
