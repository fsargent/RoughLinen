	<p>After owning typical beach cottages in Destin, FL the last 25 years, we purchased a very contemporary, open floor plan home with lots of light and beautiful beach views of the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
	<p>I had 4 beds to dress and immediately knew I wanted bedding from Rough Linen! </p>
	<p>Three of the four beds are complete and will be ordering the fourth soon. All our guests comment on the linens, so simple, yet so elegant!</p>
	<p>Thank you Rosalind</p>
