A request from the folk who run Philip Johnson's Glass House,&nbsp;<em>&quot;could they use my bed linen?&quot;</em>&nbsp;In the Glass House? <em>THE</em> Glass House? Oh, yes!
<br> I told my good friends at Remodelista, who in turn contacted The Glass House for permission, to do a photo shoot.
<br> One day in June, 2014, Margot Guralnick and I arrived on site with Matthew Williams, a professional stills photographer.
<br> I took my video camera and shot away myself.
<br> Margot's Remodelista article is&nbsp;<a style="color:gray" href="http://www.remodelista.com/posts/lessons-in-minimalism-from-the-glass-house-by-philip-johnson-new-canaan-connecticut">here</a>.
