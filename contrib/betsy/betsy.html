<p>After raising three boys my husband and I are now empty nesters with 5 dogs and 3 cats. We both work in the downtown Minneapolis area, but live about 35 miles away. The drive can be long, especially in the winter. We have thought about downsizing, but our house is surrounded by trees and nature; deer walk through the front yard, squirrels stealing food from the bird feeder…our quiet, our sanctuary.  After research and reading reviews, we initially ordered sheets, pillow slips, duvet cover and bed skirt….and everything is truly wonderful. The feel, texture, the ease and the beautifully elegant simple look makes our bedroom a thing of beauty.  I have also ordered and use every day, the pinafore, and dish towels.</p>
