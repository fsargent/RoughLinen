<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have gotten to the point in our lives where we don't want to move again, and don't want to buy anything that isn't quality that's going to last. Started with Rough Linen sheet and pillow cases. Love the feeling so much, bought a duvet cover. Thought about a platform bed but Tricia said they &quot;are hard on your shins&quot; ;-). So, bought the bedskirt and now our bed is complete. We'll just take the comforter out of the duvet in the summer and use it as a blanket. Colorado has such variable weather that linen is perfect here at 7,000 feet in elevation any time of year.
<br /> When I'm not in my linen sheets it seems I'm in my linen pinafore. It serves me well whether I'm doing mosaics, painting, or gardening.
<br /> Next to come is the shower curtain to make our bedroom suite complete. ~ lisa</font>
