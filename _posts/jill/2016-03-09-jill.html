	<p>We're long time adherents of linen "linens", but have been blown away by the quality of Rough Linens. We live in Alabama, where we have two seasons:  hot and not quite as hot. We purchased a summer bed, in the middle of winter,  and found it, combined with a light blanket,  made for perfect sleep. Also, the provide a comfortable lounging spot for watching beautiful sunsets. The cats are also fans! They'd like to know if you make pet bedding. ;)</p>
