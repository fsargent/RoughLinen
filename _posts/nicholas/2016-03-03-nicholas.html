<p>These sheets have absolutely changed my life. I live in a charming apartment in Brooklyn with tons of light and exposed brick. I've always been a bed-low-to-the-ground sort of person, and these luxurious sheets (2 slips, 2 shames, sheet, and duvet pictured) have made it virtually impossible to leave my bed.</p>
<p>Here's the key: warm enough for cold winter nights, but cool and breathable for when the sun spills in in the morning and heats everything up. Absolute life changer!</p>
<p>Sending some photos of the bed made (pictured sleeping is my Japanese friend, Rilakkuma!) and of it all tossed up, in which state I think it looks even more alluring. :-)</p>
<p>Taking a shot for the credit (I either want a summer cover or even better, to entice my girlfriend to pick up her own set!) but no hard feelings either way!</p>
