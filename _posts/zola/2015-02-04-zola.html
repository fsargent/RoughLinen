Elegant • Fabulous • Wonderful • Soothing • Love
<br /> Can't say enough about your lovely sheets. They are awesome. I am thrilled your linens are in my house too!  Also love my new pinafore  ~in black~ makes projects much more  ~Artsy~.  I am sleeping in pure luxury thanks to you Tricia!
Wanted to show you what I paired with your smooth linen sheets. A pure linen blanket (from Brahms Mount) topped with a down comforter.  Everything is light and luscious. Love the properties of linen. When at work I dream of being in bed smiling and cooing! Never slept in anything better.
<br /> I am Soooo please with your expertise Tricia and your awesome linen products. Well done! Love my Harley and coffee too! ~ Zola
