  <p>My name is Melanie Walsh. I am a Mom of 5 wonderful kids. I am known <a href="http://myrusticfarmhouse.blogspot.com">online as Rustic Farmhouse</a>.
My home has been featured in Prairie Style &amp; Landhaus Living magazine and another upcoming Prairie feature this August for which I was the stylist.
</p><p>
I am a LINEN lover and have collected many linen pieces over the years. I have collected nice thick homespun antique linen which your Rough Linen product resembles.
</p><p>
I LOVE the texture and color of my pinny so much that now I want a duvet cover as well! Heck, I'd love one of everything!</p><p>
  Your linen is simple. It has old world charm. It has a comfort about it.</p>
