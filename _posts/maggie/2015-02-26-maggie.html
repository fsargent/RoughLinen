We live on Nantucket Island. My fiancé and I just bought our first house. We’re blessed enough to be able to hear the waves crashing from our bedroom and are loving the new duvet; basking in the magic of it all. I waited with baited breath for our duvet to arrive, only two days even with the added distance of being on an island out at sea.
<br /> While my fiancé first balked at the large expense, shortly thereafter I found him lounging in bed with our doggies admitting that “this linen stuff” was pretty fantastic!
<br /> I worked in boutique hotels for years and good sheets are one of the few luxury items I insist that we splurge on. Pratesi was my go to for years, but I hated that after two nights in it, they felt like they needed to be washed a pressed again (a luxury that two 30 somethings could not justify). Nice percale cotton was my next love, but even the most expensive don’t hold a candle to this rough linen ~ Maggie
