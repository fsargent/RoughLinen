<p>I have been searching for the last few months for some simple linen curtains for my bedroom in Ojai, CA. I pretty much looked at every catalog offering and then I found your site.</p><p>I loved your Smooth White Linen sheets for the bed, so decided to make the curtains myself from your sheet fabric &#8212; with a very large pocket at the top so they might look like they were casually draped over the rod.</p>
<p>They are the perfect weight, heavy enough to keep the room dark at night &#8212; but sheer enough to let in filtered diffused sunshine during the day. The pretty stitching on the hem gives them a more finish look&hellip;</p>
<p>I now have 5 sets of these covering my vintage and not so beautiful windows. They catch a breeze and move around &#8212; no rings, no pulls, no bells 'n whistles.</p>
<p>Simple can be really beautiful. ~ <a href="http://ppebble.blogspot.com/">Kelley Motschenbacher.</a></p>
