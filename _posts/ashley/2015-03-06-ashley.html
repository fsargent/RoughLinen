Hi Tricia! I have been eyeing your linen bedding for over a year now. For my bridal shower in July, my mother bought me my first Rough Linen item&hellip;a pinafore! I adore it and cannot wait to cook and bake in it in my new home after the wedding, October 18, 2014!
<br /> My fianc√© and I built a 950 sq ft apartment over a garage that we call &quot;The Barn&quot;. We are surrounded by gorgeous Larch trees! In the next few years we will build our house next to The Barn. I attached photos of our beautiful kitchen, living room, bath and bedroom. As you can see, our bedroom is last to decorate. And I can't wait to purchase our Rough Linen bedding with some wedding money!! Just in time for a cold PA winter in the woods! ~ Ashley
