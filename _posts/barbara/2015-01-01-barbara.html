<p>Hi Tricia, I am proud to include your gorgeous linens as one of my collection of obsessions!</p>
<p>We have just finished building vacation home in the Columbia River, Gorge of Oregon, and I was thrilled to to use a different palette of my favorite things in this home. Two is better than one!</p>
<p>Enjoy a few pictures of the new home and the home in Portland. Thanks for your talent!</p>
