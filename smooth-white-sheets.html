            <p>My pure Belgian 100% linen sheeting comes in two colors, natural and white, which harmonize perfectly with the original, heavier Orkney fabric, both natural and white. I have it woven to my specification to be the quality and heft equivalent to brands costing twice as much. Don't compare this with even high-end chain store linen &#8212; this is better. Sheeting is close-woven and smooth in texture, in contrast to the 'rough' of rustic Orkney which resembles traditional homespun. Its double width makes it suitable for sheets (no one wants a seam in a sheet!) but its finer weave and smoothness are also well suited for pillowslips, napkins and tablecloths, especially when the two textures are in contrast.</p>
