            <br>
            <p>If you feel you might need a top sheet, I always reply that its only function is to wrap itself round your legs, and to complicate making the bed. A top sheet is necessary with blankets and fixed-cover comforters, but European-style duvets have removable covers for easy washing.</p>
            <p>As an alternative to a top sheet, opt for the versatile <a href="rough-linen-summer-cover.html">summer cover</a></p>

        <p><em>"This is the best purchase I have ever made for myself
After a full year of looking, buying and returning bedding from some of my favorite companies, I came back to the bedding that caught my eye over a year ago. I was hesitant, not believing any linen bought in America would be worthy of this price point. (I was considering buying from Ireland) I am happy to say I was VERY wrong!!
Like so many other people that write reviews of your products, I can't really explain it, but I have not slept this well in years! I actually get excited about going to bed now!
Stranger still...I LOVE sitting in my room &#8212; just LOOKING at how gorgeous my bed is!!! It is absolutely stunning! This is the best purchase I have ever made for myself. There will be no hesitation as I look forward to purchasing curtains, tablecloths and pillows from you next. Thank you SO very much for such a lovely, high quality, beautiful product!! Thanks, too, for always answering my questions so honestly and so promptly!"</em> – Bradenton, Florida</p>

        <p><em>"Trisha, like all the the comments I read, I was beyond thrilled to get my exquisitely packaged linens. The package was heavy! And, a tiny bit embarrassed to say, I chased after the mail truck to make sure I got them rather than a disappointing mail slip for the next day.
Anyways, I almost made myself late for work putting them on my bed. I hope I can sleep in them before washing 'cuz tonight I am going to. They are the real deal.

They are stunning in their authentic, lost old world quality. It brings back the memory of my first French outdoor market experience after growing up on american '60's processed food: a feast for the senses, and then profound satisfaction! I have to keep going in to look at them."</em></p>

        <p><em>"Dear Tricia and team,
I SO LOVE my new linen! I read your website carefully before purchasing and felt I was making an informed decision. But it was all way BETTER than expected. The hand wrapped and ribboned parcels were just delightful (and it takes A LOT for me to be thrilled about packaging) and the linen itself &#8212; AMAZING!

And my bed make over. I was so impressed with the custom fit &#8212; perfect, perfect perfect. The smooth linen sheets have been heaven to sleep on. It is just such a pleasure to relax each evening in such splendid, yet "simple" surrounds. I purchased both a summer cover and the duvet cover &#8212; and the timing was optimal &#8212; within a few days of putting on the summer cover, Autumn weather arrived and I had a chance to use the duvet cover. I love it all. All I can say is I can't recommend Rough Linen highly enough. Kindness"</em>

        <p><em>"Oh my goodness! I opened my Rough Linen package and it was a happy day! You have made this Southern belle so very pleased. Each item was individually wrapped up, tied up in ribbon with a sweet care label &#8212; Merry Christmas and Happy Birthday too....I'm so excited. I ordered the bed makeover; smooth white for bottom sheet and pillow slips then St. Barts natural for duvet, pillow shams and summer cover (instead of a bed skirt).
My husband loves the summer cover.
When I enter our bedroom now, I just take a deep breath and smile. Our bedroom is truly a sanctuary.
Your work is Gorgeous . You give a new meaning to " understated elegance." I'll send pictures soon.
Thank you so very much."</em> <strong>Susan</strong></p>

        <em><p>"YOU are a genius!</p>
                    <p>Tricia,</p>
                    <p>I dearly love my bed makeover! It's been a joke in our family how often I have changed linens and quilts etc. over the years. They won't laugh any more! It was this I was looking for to look beautiful and cover me in luxury. Linen has always been my favorite material as long as I can remember. I can now wear it during the day and sleep on it every evening.
                    My first night of contentment I slept in until 8:30 am! I am always up by 6:00. The minute I crawled under the duvet the evening before I felt as if I were exactly where I wanted and needed to be. I know I sound a bit off-center, but these linens are what I have searched for at least ten years!"<strong>Jeanette</strong></p>

        <p><em>"I was worried about spending so much on the bed makeover and whether there would be a piece that wasn't as useful as the others but it really was worth every little piece for what they have added to comfort, looks and ease of care...
My 'other' brand linen pieces look really poor quality next to yours yet yours are better priced...
Thank you Tricia! Really glad I found you and sure I will be getting some more pieces..."</em> <strong>Jen</strong> – Brisbane, Australia</p>

        <p><em>"Hi Tricia,
<p>I am not sure where to start since each element in the bed makeover really adds something special...</p><br>

THE SHEETS
<p>I know everyone says the sheets were soft but I am not sure I really got what that meant until I got mine. Truly there is something you can't quite put your finger on in terms of how soft and pillowy the bed feels with your linen sheets.</p>
My husband was doubtful about the flat sheet but it has not moved an inch. I have to say I put on my old 1200 count cotton fitted sheet just to prove to myself that I wasn't imagining things and it just feels 'tight' in comparison, bits of the mattress show etc.</p><br>

THE SUMMER COVER
<p>The summer cover has been just perfect since we have had a lot of warm nights already and we really have not needed anything else &#8212; and its only September. I usually would have  a wool quilt on still and put up with a little sweating... No more.</p><br>

THE BOLSTERS
<p>And then the bolsters... they really have transformed things and do everything that the website says. No piles of foo foo cushions and pillows to send my husband nuts (or snoozing spots for Wil, our new dog, in the night).</p><br>

THE PILLOWS
    <p>One pillow is just right for reading and snuggling in to sleep, and then in the morning I just pull up the cover and plump the two pillows and we are set to go again...</p>
<p>So as I say, I am not sure which piece has been the best..."</em></p>
