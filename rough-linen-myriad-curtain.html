                    <p class="clearBoth">These sheer, almost weightless curtain panels are made from an off-white, open-weave pure linen 66" wide – shrinks to 64" after washing. I like to allow one 64" panel per 36" of window, or only a little less, to be on the generous side, as the fabric is so light and airy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I always recommend ring-clips, not only to be able to draw the curtains easily, but you can adjust the length by folding the top over if necessary. </p>

            <p><em>"I must apologise for not writing sooner to thank you for such speedy delivery of my Myriad curtains, they are absolutely gorgeous and I just love them! I have been waiting three weeks for my curtain clips to arrive to be able to put them up, and today was the day of their arrival, and so my husband has been working this afternoon to install the curtains. And as you can see by the photos that I am sending they look beautiful. I thought I might only need two on my big window, but I think it would look better if I had another two, just to give it that nice fullness. The door also needs another one, so after I send the pics to you I shall order three more. I do hope you like how the curtains look. Thank you once again. I look forward to receiving my next shipment from you. Kind regards"</em> – <strong><a href="contrib/heather/heather.html">Heather</a></strong></p>
