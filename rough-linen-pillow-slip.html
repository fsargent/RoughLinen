            <p class="clearBoth">Pillow slips cover the pillow you sleep on, so fine weave and smoothness are important.</p>
            <p><strong>Simple</strong> linen pillow slips are as plain as can be, with a 2" hem.</p>
            <p><strong>Oxford</strong> linen pillow slips are more formal, with a 2" flange all round.</p>
            <p>All have a European-style deep tuck to hold the pillow inserts securely inside so they don't show.</p>
            <p>Pillow slips come in one fabric (Smooth) and two colors. Natural is a soft taupe, straight from the field. White has been yarn-bleached for strength, without optical brighteners, so it comes to you a soft off-white, and will lighten with washing and use.</p>
            <p>My close-woven, commissioned sheeting is water-finished, no need to wash before use. Allowance is made for shrinkage.</p>

            <p><em>"Little luxuries go a long way toward easing these times when there is little money left over for extras.</em></p>
            <p><em>I recently splurged on a purchase from Rough Linen, the company of Tricia Rose. I ordered a simple pillow slip made from smooth linen fabric. The design of the pillow case is unique with a deep tuck to hold the pillow insert securely inside so it doesn&rsquo;t show.</em></p>
            <p><em>As a quilter, crafter, and seamstress, I am drawn to fabric, but not so much for the pattern, or even the color. What pulls me in is the feel, the texture, the drape of the fabric. The more natural and organic the better.</em></p>
            <p><em>My new pillow slip brought sweet dreams to my sleep. I scented mine with fresh lavender. I am carrying my luxurious pillow with me all about the house. I propped up my feet to read and rested my head for a nap. And, when I ventured outside on a gorgeous almost summer day, I lay on a quilt with my head on the linen pillow cover and looked up at the sunlit sky. My heart is grateful.</em></p>
            <p><em>Linen is a lesson in life for me. For years, I shied away from this seemingly troublesome fabric. I would iron and spray starch and try to force this fabric to behave properly. Within seconds after ironing, linen will go all wrinkly and wavy again. Finally, I came to accept the nature of linen and appreciate its beauty. I stopped fighting its natural properties and embraced this enduring fabric.</em></p>
            <p><em>Learning to love linen is not unlike learning to love myself. I cannot iron or starch myself into a proper shape with perfect hair and faultless ways.</em></p>
            <p><em>I am perfectly imperfect. I hope you find a little luxury in your life."</em> – <a href="http://picmeupphotos.blogspot.com/2013/06/little-luxuries.html"><strong>Donna Hopkins</strong></a></p>

        <p><em>So now, I am saving to purchase your sheets and duvet, (and another pillow case, of course!) My question is, what is the suggested care of these products. Do you recommend that they not go in the dryer? I'll be ordering again very soon. Oh, and the sample of lavender scented linen laundry soap almost sent me though the roof. The smell is simply incredible! So glad to have found you!"</em> – <strong>Renee</strong></p>
