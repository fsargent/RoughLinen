            <p class="clearBoth">Orkney linen tea towels &#8212; <em>"we only dry our glasses with linen"</em> &#8212; I didn't think there was a market until linen-loving customers demanded it.</p>
            <p>Nice big loop on the top to hang it with, suggested by Remodelista founder and style maven Julie. What a good idea. Thanks Julie!</p>

            <p><em>"What more can I say, everything from Rough Linen is beautiful and these tea towels are no exception. They are a pleasure to use, so tactile, and do a fantastic job when drying up. There is always one hanging on the rail of my AGA."</em> – <b>Trisha</b> of Haslemere, United Kingdom</p>
            <p><em>"What a perfect way to dry dishes! This tea towel is both beautiful (in it's colour &amp; simplicity) &amp; beautifully functional in it's ability to dry my crystal to a sparkling, spotless finish. Now an indispensable part of my kitchen."</em> – <strong>Chris</strong> of Denman Islan, British Columbia</p>
            <p><em>"I've really enjoyed using these in the kitchen. I don't use paper towels, so I have a lot of tea towels on hand, and these have become my favorite. Strong, lovely, quite absorbent."</em> – Glenview, Illinois</p>
