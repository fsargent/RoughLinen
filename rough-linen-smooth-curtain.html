            <p class="clearBoth">I make these wonderful curtains from Smooth linen, the same linen that I use in my sheets and pillow slips.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am indebted to Kelley Motschenbacher who first thought of using my sheets for curtains. These days you don't have to do that &#8212; read her story below ...</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our version has a 2” casing at the top, 5” closed hem at the bottom.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I always recommend ring-clips – not only do they draw more easily, you can adjust length and create inverted pleats, even hang a blackout layer without interfering with the flow of the linen. Easiest way to choose ring clips is to Google ‘drapery ring clips' and then click <em>Images</em>. No wading through ads or descriptions, just useful pictures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Custom sizing is possible, email me for a quote.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also make curtains in <a href="rough-linen-orkney-curtain.html">Orkney</a>, <a href="rough-linen-myriad-curtain.html">Myriad</a>, and <a href="rough-linen-st-barts-curtain.html">St Barts</a> linen.</p>

            <em><p>"I have been searching for the last few months for some simple linen curtains for my bedroom in Ojai, CA. I pretty much looked at every catalog offering and then I found your site.</p>
                <p>I loved your Smooth white Linen sheets for the bed, so decided to make the curtains myself from your sheet fabric &#8212; with a very large pocket at the top so they might look like they were casually draped over the rod.</p>
                <p>They are the perfect weight, heavy enough to keep the room dark at night &#8212; but sheer enough to let in filtered diffused sunshine during the day. The pretty stitching on the hem gives them a more finish look...</p>
                <p>I now have 5 sets of these covering my vintage and not so beautiful windows. They catch a breeze and move around &#8212; no rings, no pulls, no bells 'n whistles.</p>
                <p>Simple can be really beautiful."</p>
