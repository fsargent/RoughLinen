            <p class="clearBoth">A summer cover is somewhere between a sheet and a bed cover &#8212; just what you need for hot summer nights. Use it instead of a sheet and slip in underneath &#8212; aaaah &#8212; bliss... the three inch hems and mitered corners look neat and structured whether the bed is made or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The summer cover was inspired by requests from customers in Texas, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, who know all about living in hot climates. It is a single layer of fabric, with linen’s characteristic cool, crisp ‘hand’.
            </p>
            <p>
                Available in all Orkney, Smooth, and St Barts colors. I love the St Barts blue. Other St Barts <a href="rough-linen-st-barts-colors.html">colors</a> may be available by request, for an additional charge.
            </p>
            <p>
                No CalKing size. The king is large enough for a CalKing bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you prefer a top sheet with your duvet in spite of all my dissuasion, consider trying the more versatile summer cover instead.

        <p><strong>No longer need to run the a/c at night!!<br>
</strong><em>"I am one of those people who hates sleeping without a cover, even though it gets hot and muggy during the summer where I live. And yet, I also hate running the air conditioner all night--it dries out the air and I wake up with cold skin and that awful refrigerated feeling.<br>
The summer cover (in Orkney) has the weight of of a blanket, and yet is thoroughly breathable. Plus the linen looks magnificent. Give it a try and actually enjoy sleeping during the warmer months. Wake up comfortable, not clammy, and do the planet (and your wallet) a favor, and kill the a/c!"</em> – Swarthmore, Pennsylvania</p>

        <p><em>"Kudos to you and your staff. I ordered my new linens last week and they arrived yesterday. I was in love the moment I opened the box. My daughter-in-law looked in the box and said, "they must really love 'em to wrap 'em like that." 

My sentiments exactly. I was so giddy I could barely finish making the bed. I just wanted to crawl in for a nap. They are beautiful. 

I was torn on what to order. I love the St Barts blue and thought about it as a duvet. In the end, I ordered the bed makeover but swapped the bed skirt for the summer cover in St Barts and it worked beautifully as a pop of color laid across the foot of the bed (that is what I had in my mind... YAY). 

And then I can use it as an intended summer cover as the weather warms up. 

Thank you so much! I had a fantastic night's sleep and my heart jumps for joy every time I entered my bedroom today."</em>

        <p><em>"The Summer Cover is terrific. I have a king size bed with a four-inch mattress topper, which makes it very difficult to find linens that adequately cover the bed. This product is generously sized and drapes well over the sides. It is beautifully made, very comfortable and perfect for warm nights."</em> – Portland, Oregon</p>

        <p><em>"I received my order just about 2 weeks ago. I ordered 2 summer covers, 2 sheets, and 2 pillow slips. These are extraordinary. From the workmanship, the quality and the feel of the linen, to the wonderful way they are wrapped and shipped. The linen bag filled with lavender is such a lovely touch. The St. Bart's blue summer cover is such a beautiful color. Best way to describe it is sea glass. These linens feel so wonderful. They are soft and cozy and feel weightless. They launder beautifully. I cannot recommend these highly enough. They are a splurge to be sure but they are so worth it. I look forward to many wonderful nights on these beautiful linens. I will be ordering more items from Rough Linen in the future. So happy I found this company."</em> <strong>Karen</strong> – Essex Junction, Vermont

        <p><em>"I have been hemming and hawing about this summer cover for a while. Finally took the plunge and am SO GLAD. 
This blanket/sheet thing is AMAZING!!!
Yes, it's rough, but in the most luxurious, stretch out like a cat and purr every morning kind of way. Rough, but soft, not silky soft, nubbly soft. 
Keeps you at the perfect temperature. And washes so so well. Which I do often with a 6 month old, co-sleeping baby. She loves this summer cover. 
The natural Orkney is a lovely grey/taupe/greige. Actually pairs surprisingly well with the natural smooth sheet. (Which I also adore). Makes a lovely, earthy bed. 
Definitely wash and dry a couple of times before using to soften up. I love Caldrea products for my linens. 
Rough Lunen is the best Lunen available. I've tried a few and this takes them all."</em> – Fairfield, Iowa</p>

Beautiful fabric and ample size for our king size bed! I also ordered the shams this time. I already had shams for my 1st cover. LOVE it!"</em> <strong>Lisa</strong> – Columbia, South Carolina</p>

        <p>Designer <strong><a href="http://richardostell.com/">Richard Ostell</a></strong>: <em>"In the master bedroom, the floors are bare and the windows are simple white blackout roller blinds. The king-size summer cover in natural Orkney linen is from Rough Linen."<br>
"My approach to interiors is the same as my approach to product design; simplicity, balance, proportion. I like space and calm, even in small rooms. I prefer interiors that have a relaxed feel, spaces that look cohesive but don't look designed or 'done'; that have a feeling of restraint and quiet. Environments that have a soul and reﬂect the owners' personality, objects that mean something, not bought to ﬁll a gap. When someone asks me to design their home, the collaboration is what's important. I like to ﬁnd out how they live, what they need from their homes, what space and calm and simplicity mean to them."</em>
