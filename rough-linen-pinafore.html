            <p class="clearBoth">A pinafore is like an apron but better.</p>
            <p>I love my Orkney linen pinafore. It has two deep pockets so your iPhone doesn't fall out and doesn't have to mix with your keys.  It wraps around to protect your clothes at the side as well as the front.</p>
            <p>Go ahead, dry your hands on it, or pick up the corners to hold things in &#8212; apples, laundry, toys. Pocket your hair band or a letter to post so you don't need to remember. You will look competent and artisanal without channelling a crazed Betty Draper.</p>
            <p>Adult size fits almost anyone as the crossover at the back adjusts from vertical to X, but we added Large so our sisters 20+ don&rsquo;t feel left out. Don&rsquo;t order Large unless you weigh more than 200lbs. Petite Adult is 5" shorter, for those 5'1" and under.</p>
            <p>We wear them all day long. Last week I wore my pinafore under a jacket to the swanky Left Bank restaurant in Larkspur. Maybe I went too far.</p>
            <p>More than a pinny &#8212; it's a way of life.</p>

However, I'm tall and I would rather it was longer&hellip;I realize there's nothing you can do about that. I'm using it in my studio and am tempted to order another for the kitchen. If I do, I would then request a longer version. Great service. Living in Australia, it arrived in no time. I did figure out how to put it on. I couldn't quite catch it by the video and would find an instruction sheet handy. Definitely a 5 star rating."</em> – <strong>Rhonda</strong> of Melbourne, Australia</p>

This is just like something I would wear&#58; Unique fabrics, unexpected proportions and well worn (loved) pieces paired with structured pieces.

            <p><em>Santa brought me a &quot;pinny!&quot;<br /> I recall my mum wearing these back in the '50's when England was getting back to normal after WW2. My mum made her own pinafores, and I had my little girl version stitched up on her old Singer treadle machine.</em></p>
            <p><em>Since then we seem to have graduated to silly skimpy aprons, which don't give much protection to our clothing, especially those of us who require more than a sideways sliding minibib across &apos;the girls&apos;! They are an embarrassment when having to meet the UPS or FEDEX guy at the front door!</em></p>
            <p><em>The true pinafore, such as Tricia's design, wraps around the sides to the back, with wide comfy shoulder straps, and the entire garment stays in place without the need to tie strings. The large pockets are very handy, and even if you don't cook much, the linen pinny is great when crafting, gardening, decorating, even for an emergency run to the grocery over your jeans and tee shirt etc.</em></p>
            <p><em>Thrown into the washer, dried gently and hung while still a wee bit damp, it takes on a lovely natural wrinkly appearance, like above, and ironing it would spoil the special look, so don't bother."</em></p>

Well, now that my pinafore has I arrived I can hardly stand it. Call me crazy, or just a lover of natural fibers, but now I REALLY can't wait. The linen is beautiful, just beautiful. It is a pleasure to look at, to wear and to touch. I usually wear a full apron but this pinafore will now replace all aprons. It is so much more practical and so much more attractive. If only it had a few more inches in back I could wear it as a dress. I 'm not kidding; that is how much I love it. I'm smitten. I just had an idea&hellip;I am heading to AZ this week and I will need one at our home there too, so I will place an order for another pinafore.

            <p>From Elaine, who couldn't wait to sent me this lovely photo the day after Xmas.
                <em>I bought my pinafore earlier this year to wear on Christmas Day. I did, and I loved it! I received so many compliments from our guests, even my twenty two year old granddaughter.  Thank you again for such a great product.</em>

            <p>Customers everywhere send me photos. Here's a group having Xmas fun. Two charcoal and one natural pinafore, and a maverick in our apron.</p>
