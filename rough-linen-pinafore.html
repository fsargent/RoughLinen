                    <p class="clearBoth">A pinafore is like an apron but better.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I love my Orkney linen pinafore. It has two deep pockets so your iPhone doesn't fall out and doesn't have to mix with your keys.  It wraps around to protect your clothes at the side as well as the front.</p>
                    <p>Go ahead, dry your hands on it, or pick up the corners to hold things in - apples, laundry, toys. Pocket your hair band or a letter to post so you don't need to remember. You will look competent and artisanal without channelling a crazed Betty Draper.</p>
                    <p>Adult size fits almost anyone as the crossover at the back adjusts from vertical to X, but we added Large so our sisters 20+ don&rsquo;t feel left out. Don&rsquo;t order Large unless you weigh more than 200lbs. Petite Adult is 5" shorter, for those 5'1" and under.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We wear them all day long. Last week I wore my pinafore under a jacket to the swanky Left Bank restaurant in Larkspur. Maybe I went too far.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>More than a pinny - it's a way of life.</p>

                    <p><em>"We moved to our rural home just a few years ago and in doing so we have become much more connected to the land and all its inhabitants. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't notice the surrounding fields changing as growing season is in earnest. It seems that almost as soon as planting is done, the winter wheat is harvested.
My pinafore is now a wardrobe mainstay. I have worn an apron as long as I can remember, and it probably has something to do with my French grandmother wearing her full apron."</em> – <strong>Brenda M.</strong></p>

I recently ordered a pinafore from you. I am wearing it today as I have everyday since its arrival! I adore it! It is the perfect topper to the creative souls wardrobe.
I had my daughter home this weekend and we went outside on this beautiful NC day to do bit of a photo shoot.
Of course I was wearing my Rough Linen pinafore! You requested pictures, so I am sending along a few.

I tore into the tissue wrapped packages searching frantically for my pinafore.  Of course it was at the bottom of the box. Tricia you are a linen genius! The bread bags, the linen sachets, the generous sized towels so cool.  But that pinafore is 'the cat's meow' (No generation since my parents' have coined a better more descriptive phrase).<br>

I am the messiest cook ever. Actually messy with about everything I do and I hate aprons that tie when I'm on the move.  You mentioned wearing yours to lunch recently. If I'm any judge I'm going to need more than one of these.<br>

Really love the pinafore. The pockets are perfect for accommodating your lovely linen tea towel (i.e., I fold in a long rectangle, tuck one end of towel in the pocket and drape the rest to hang out of the pocket). I ordered the Valentine heart embellishment. Would like to have a shamrock,thistle, rose, snow flake, sun, and pumpkin!"</em> – <strong>Claire</strong> of Minneapolis, Minnesota</p>

What a comfy and useful item fashioned in your beautiful natural linen! Also, any clothing item with pockets automatically rates an extra star ( so this should probably be a six star review.)

I really could have chosen which linen would be best from the sample card.
But ever since I came across your website I have been so excited about ordering my sheets and curtains.
Well, now that my pinafore has I arrived I can hardly stand it. Call me crazy, or just a lover of natural fibers, but now I REALLY can't wait.
The linen is beautiful, just beautiful.
It is a pleasure to look at, to wear and to touch.
I usually wear a full apron but this pinafore will now replace all aprons.
It is so much more practical and so much more attractive. If only it had a few more inches in back I could wear it as a dress. I 'm not kidding; that is how much I love it.
I'm smitten. I just had an idea...I am heading to AZ this week and I will need one at our home there too, so I will place an order for another pinafore.
Please know how grateful I am that I came across your website. Lucky me...Lucky stars."</em> – <strong>Margaret</strong> of Carmel, Indiana</p>
