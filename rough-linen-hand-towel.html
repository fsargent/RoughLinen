            <p class="clearBoth">I love thin, sturdy linen towels because they dry quickly and rarely smell musty, since linen is inherently antimicrobial. Be warned; if you prefer soft, fluffy towels, stay away from linen. The crisp ‘hand’ of these Orkney linen towels is bracing, invigorating and for adults only. Your skin will feel clean, polished and wide awake.</p>
            <p>The hand towel is particularly chic and forgiving in black, (also available in natural, white and charcoal).</p>
            <p>Measures 24"x18" with a 2" hem all around, mitred corners, and a 4" loop to hang it by.</p>

            <p><em>"I love the feel and texture of linen and this Rough Linen hand towel which is perfect for the bathroom.</em></p>
            <p><em>There is something so earthy about the texture and color of rough linen.</em></p>
            <p><em>It has an air of simplicity which I love&hellip;</em></p>
            <p><em>I will be ordering more.</em></p>
            <p><em>The quality and workman ship is excellent.</em></p>

        <p><em>I think it must be a magical combo of great craftsmanship, great quality linen and all the love you infuse into each piece.</em></p>
        <p><em>I have just gotten the tea towel too&hellip;which tomorrow I will use on a tray to serve a proper pot of tea on! Pics of that will follow.</em></p>
