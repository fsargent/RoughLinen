            <p class="clearBoth"><strong>A summer bed is a combination of a summer cover, a sheet and two simple pillow slips.</strong></p>
            <p>A summer cover is somewhere between a sheet and a bed cover &#8212; just what you need for hot summer nights. Use it instead of a sheet and slip in underneath &#8212; aaaah &#8212; bliss&hellip; the three&#8212;inch hems and mitred corners look neat and structured whether the bed is made or not.</p>
            <p>The summer cover was inspired by requests from customers in Texas, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, who know all about living in hot climates. It is a single layer of fabric, with linen’s characteristic cool, crisp ‘hand’.</p>

        <p><em>"There is one word that captures the experience of Rough Linen: Perfection.</em></p>
        <p><em>What more can be said? I thought I was sleeping well, but didn't realize until I received the Summer Bed how much better sleep could be. Cool and breathable, cozy and insulating, it is as though the fabric intuitively senses fluctuations as the air conditioner cycles on and off. The summer cover is truly ideal for much of the year in Florida, but surely I'll be ordering a duvet cover and another sheet/pillow slip set as the weather turns cooler. The beautiful Orkney linen floats softly, barely grazing the skin and the smooth sheet and pillow slips are decadently sensuous, but I'm getting ahead of myself.</em></p>
        <p><em>First things first &#8212; pull back the summer cover and slip into bed. Propped up by pillow and bolster (gorgeous Orkney fabric stuffed with king pillows, as recommended), I'm situated perfectly for reading in bed. So comfy. Feel like a princess. No need to move the bolster when I'm done reading. Slide down onto the pillow and drift into sleep.</em></p>
        <p><em>The mitered corners and flawless stitching add to the luxurious experience. And the tuck to secure the pillow is an extra special detail.</em></p>
        <p><em>My husband's take on this is simple and to the point &#8212; Wow, beautiful fabric. Feel is extraordinary.</em></p>
        <p><em>Thanks, Tricia."</em> <strong>Jane</strong> – St. Petersburg, Florida</p>

        <p><em>"If it's pay day, it must be time to order more Rough Linen! I am thrilled with the summer bed I ordered a couple of weeks ago. We've had some extremely hot nights, and just in the last day or so a couple of unseasonably cool ones. The summer cover has been perfect through all of it! I did not realize how often I was waking up during the night to throw off or pull up bed clothes until I started sleeping onthe summer bed.</em></p>

        <p><em>Now I fall asleep and stay asleep. It's fabulous! I also sew and deeply admire your craftmanship and attention to detail. I could go on but I'd better press the order button &hellip; thank you so much!"</em>

        <p><em>"I have been shopping stores in Atlanta for a while looking for real linen sheets. The words linen, threadcount, etc are so overused these days. When I discovered your website, I was excited enough when I hit the purchase button on the computer and extremely and pleasantly surprised when they arrived so quickly.</em></p>

        <p><em>I opened the package like I was a kid on Christmas morning. The lavender smell set the entire tone. I have never slept better in my life. I never want a fitted sheet again and in an ideal world, i want your lavender bags in every corner of my house:)</em></p>

        <p><em>My daughter sometimes sleeps in my bed and "steals the covers" and the "cool". That is no longer a problem now that our sheets are big enough to fit the mattress and are such exquisite quality.</em></p>

        <p><em>Rough Linen holds the "cool" (yes, hospital corners--I was raised that way). You have spoiled me and my daughter for life:)
        My next purchase will be to outfit her bed.</em></p>

        <p><em>Thank you, thank you for your passion and attention to detail. I have already praised Rough Linen to two dozen friends. Best Regards"</em> <strong>Joy</strong> – Atlanta, GA</p>

        <p><em>"Perfect for the summer nights here! My husband was a bit skeptical but in the last two weeks, we've both become converts to this simple, elegant set-up. Our 3 year old gets upset if we don't wait for her to help us make the 'silver bed.' So, to sum up: Summer Bed is brilliant! The fabric gets softer with every wash, it looks elegant, it feels terrific. We plan to get the duvet when it gets cold again."</em> <strong>Emily</strong> – Montgomery, Alabama</p>

        <p><em>"Tricia. Wow. My St Barts (pale) blue summer bed arrived earlier this week. I opened the box, and took a step back. I didn’t want to rush the experience when I saw how personally everything was packaged. I did my evening chores that night, sat down, and slowly removed each individually wrapped item. I then savored the stack of packages further before unwrapping them.</em></p>

        <p><em>The lavender bag was the first thing I unwrapped, and this set the mood for the rest of the unfurling. My house smelled of lavender as I marveled at the item labels and grosgrain ribbon – what a fabulously personal touch. I ran my hand across the fabrics and took photos;</em></p>

        <p><em>I then put my purchase aside for the rest of the week. I didn’t want to just throw it on the bed, sleep and wake up early for work – I wanted the first experience to last as long as possible.</em></p>
        <p><em>Today is Saturday and I made up my bed. I sew, and I appreciate your choice of fabrics, your workmanship, and your attention to detail. Everything fits perfect. Everything smells perfect. Everything feels perfect. I cannot wait to climb in bed tonight – I’m going to get in bed long before I’m ready to collapse so I can revel in the beautiful fabrics. </em></p>

        <p><em>Your lavender bag is my first real experience with truly fragrant lavender, and I’m hooked. I already purchased my Mrs. Meyer Clean Day in lavender for all my sheet washings (per your suggestion), and every time I wash them the smell will remind me of today.</em></p>

        <p><em>Thank you for taking the time to make such beautiful creations. I intend to add to my collection, and took photos to submit to your community page. I’m hoping one gets published so I can some of the cost of a duvet cover for the cooler months. (I am only submitting three photos; my house isn’t nearly as spectacular as the other submissions – but my bed linens are!)</em></p>

        <p><em>You’ve made my bedroom the luxe and calming sanctuary I always dreamed I’d have. (Plus, I feel very Martha &#8212; and Oprah-like having handmade linen sheets for my bed.</em></p>

        <p><em>Seriously – how is that even possible in this manufactured and disposable day and age? It’s all because of you. Thank you"</em> <strong>Andrea</strong></p>

        <p>Designer <strong><a href="http://richardostell.com/">Richard Ostell</a></strong>: <em>"In the master bedroom, the floors are bare and the windows are simple white blackout roller blinds. The king-size summer cover in natural Orkney linen is from Rough Linen.</em></p>
        <p><em>My approach to interiors is the same as my approach to product design; simplicity, balance, proportion. I like space and calm, even in small rooms. I prefer interiors that have a relaxed feel, spaces that look cohesive but don't look designed or 'done'; that have a feeling of restraint and quiet. Environments that have a soul and reﬂect the owners' personality, objects that mean something, not bought to ﬁll a gap. When someone asks me to design their home, the collaboration is what's important. I like to ﬁnd out how they live, what they need from their homes, what space and calm and simplicity mean to them."</em></p>
