        <p>Flax is one of the oldest fibers in the world (dyed flax fibers found in a <a href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/middlepaleolithic/ss/textile_dzudzuana.htm">cave in Dzudzuana</a> have been dated to 30,000 years ago), and along with wool, the most familiar and intimate. Local production was widespread as recently as a century ago, with a field set aside for flax for the farmer's wife and daughters to spin and weave into cloth for their own use and for sale.

        <p>There were larger operations as well, but linen as a cottage industry and winter occupation didn't end until the industrial revolution, when it couldn't compete with cheap cotton grown by slaves.
        </p>
        <p>Domestic production died out (attended by a lot of hardship in rural Europe), and linen became a luxury product, although young women still created the basis of their household by making, embroidering and collecting bedding and table linens before they were married.</p>

        <p>Linen continued to be valued over cotton for its stamina, luster and wonderful 'handle', but its democratic roots were long forgotten, and it became a high-maintenance starched, ironed and decorated symbol of class and status. Cotton came into common use by virtue of its low cost and ease of ironing.

        <p>I love everything about it - the color, the heft and sheen, its strength, its impeccable credentials. I hope you do too.</p>
