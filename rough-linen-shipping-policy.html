            <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
            <h2>Hours</h2>
            <p>Our hours are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. We are closed major holidays.</p>
            <p>Rough Linen products are generally shipped within a week of receiving your order. If an item is temporarily out of stock we will inform you of the expected delay. </p>
            <p>Custom made orders can take up to two weeks to fulfill.</p>
            <h2>Sales Tax</h2>
            <p>Purchases sent to any address within the State of California must include State Sales Tax. Sales tax is not required for purchases sent to other states or outside the US.</p>
            <h2>Delivery Within the United States</h2>
            <p>We ship primarily by USPS Priority Mail. For urgent deliveries we use FedEx which is only one block away. We'll charge your card the FedEx cost. </p>
            <p>We try to bill USPS and FedEx at the actual cost &#8212; making money on postage is not our business.</p>
            <p>Please note:
                <br> * Business days are Monday through Friday (except major holidays).
                <br> * Additional time should be allowed over holidays.
                <br> * Most customers find our standard delivery is prompt and cost effective.
                <br> * Errors and discrepancies in billing addresses and order information can increase the order processing time.</p>
            <h2>International Orders</h2>
            <p>We are pleased to fill orders shipped outside the US (including Canada). Allow 1 to 4 weeks for delivery to most countries. Duties and taxes will be collected at the time of delivery, if required.</p>
            <p>Orders delivered outside the US are usually shipped by USPS Priority Mail International. </p>
            <p>Every effort is made to minimize the shipping costs. Occasionally, in particular for multiple item orders, the estimated shipping cost will not be correct and we will have to adjust the charge. If the shipping &amp; handling charge is greater than quoted online we will ask for confirmation that the higher charge is acceptable before shipping the order. If the shipping &amp; handling charge is less than quoted online, we will charge you the lower amount when the order is processed.</p>
            <p>Please note:</p>
            <p>* Customs regulations require that we enclose an invoice with all orders shipped outside the US.  We also need your phone number for or on-line order form.</p>
            <p>* Duties and taxes are the responsibility of the customer and will be collected at time of delivery, if required.</p>
