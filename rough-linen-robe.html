            <p class="clearBoth">Here is our robe. Ta-da!</p>
            <p>The robe is for relaxation, contemplation, batheing, withdrawing from the world to a sanctuary, for ten precious minutes or a heavenly weekend morning (even better if you can steal it on Monday).</p>
            <p>It took us quite a while to follow up on the success of our pinny, because we had to get it right.</p>

                <p>There is no point in making what’s already out there, so these were our guidelines&#58;</p>
                <p>A really flattering, smart collar which frames your face and fits to your neck.</p>
                <p>The body is modest, but not voluminous – as the front crosses over you still want to be able to get to both pockets.</p>
                <p>Trailing sleeves annoy me – so the sleeve is neatly fitted to the wrist, and the cuff can be turned back. No more dipping your sleeves into the marmalade.</p>

            <p>We have two sizes, Small/Medium and Large, and of course nothing can fit everyone, As a guideline, both 5'10" Daiva and 4'10" Karen are wearing Small/Medium</p>
