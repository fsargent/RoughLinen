I received my pinafore two days ago and just adore it!
I'm a rug hooker and designer. I work with hand dyed wool hooked onto linen. I also design and hook handbags.
I love to weave shawls using the triloom my husband built for me. I also am an avid knitter.
Love all things fiber, and totally smitten with this line of gorgeous hand made linen products. Looking forward to adding some pieces to my own home!
Here are some photos of my pinafore, my gardens and my shawls.
