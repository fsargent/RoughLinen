These pictures were taken in my house in FL that we just finished last year. We spend half of the year here and the other half in Rochester, NY. I am artist and have included a picture of my studio work table. I primarily work in porcelain and you will see my handmade salt bowl and my handmade spoon included in a few pictures. I made the 'curly spoon' after trimming a tree in Rochester, NY.
<br /> I love your linen, especially the smooth linen. I have tablecloths for all my tables both here and in NY and also your lovely sheets! My pictures include my kitchen, the entry to the bathroom, my work table in my studio and, of course, many of your lovely sheets and tablecloths. ~ <a href="http://www.christinabrinkman.com/christina_brinkman/Home.html">Christina Brinkman</a>
