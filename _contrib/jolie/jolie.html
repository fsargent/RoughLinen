<p>I live with my husband, my young dog Bear, my cat Coco and four chickens in Floral City Florida. We live on 3 acres next to a little creek, under huge mossy Oak trees in a cabin that is just big enough for our little menagerie. I have barnwood floors and ceilings and my new linen bedding just suits our relaxed style perfectly.</p>
