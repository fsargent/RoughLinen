	<p>Hello Tricia!</p>
	<p>My husband and I recently moved into a beautiful renovated church in Philadelphia.</p>
	<p>After living in Brooklyn for over a decade, we are amazed by what a little space and light can do&hellip; and now we have plenty of new spots for Rough Linens!</p>
	<p>Loving it!</p>
	<p>Happy New Year! <a href="http://www.thewildunknown.com/">Kim Krans</a></p>
