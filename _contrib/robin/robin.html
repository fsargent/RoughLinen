I found you on the net and read all your reviews&hellip;I waited several days then ordered on Wednesday and I had my linens on Friday&hellip; and I live in Birmingham, Alabama.  I thought the customer service was great, but the linens I put on the bed are even better.  My husband and I love these wonderful sheets. So I thought I would surprise him&hellip;and boy was he.
<br /> The linens are just beautiful and just what I was hoping for. Not too much but just perfect&hellip;
I have looked for linens with the 'right look'  for ever and did not find, until now, what I was looking for&hellip;Shall I  say I want more!  The color, texture, and overall how they feel will be a good night make.

Love my Rough Linens&hellip;!! ~ robin
