Cooper, my rescue buddy, and I share a very modest 500-sq ft home. Most of our furnishings were either made in the garage or recovered from the roadside. The latest improvement was to convert a formerly empty room into a kitchenette/recycling center. My father, age 86, and I did all the work ourselves, save crawling under the house to plumb the new water line. I prize the simplicity of my little space. And immediately upon encountering Tricia's website, I knew her Rough Linens would both complement and enhance that space. I was not mistaken. Everything -- from the natural colors to the even-more-natural wrinkles -- bespeaks quality, beauty, and comfort.
