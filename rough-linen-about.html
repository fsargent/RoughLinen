        <h2 class="title">heritage</h2>
        <p>I found this homespun, hand-sewn linen pillowslip while I was clearing my grandmother's cottage in Scotland. It was made by her great-grandmother in about 1840, and was in regular use for three generations. When it came to me I used it to store lavender. Years later, by good fortune, I found a natural linen with the same wonderful homespun texture and feel, and I decided to make bedding in this simple, elemental tradition. I call it Orkney.

        <h2 class="title">Natural Materials</h2>
        <p>Orkney natural is the cornerstone of Rough Linen™. It has the traditional texture and color of homespun domestic European linen – I suspect the mill I use has very old looms for I haven't found this exact texture anywhere else. It is the strongest linen I use, for bedding, tablecloths, napkins, towels, pinafores and curtains.

        <h2 class="title">beautiful fabrics</h2>
        <p>I am always looking for definitive texture, or weave, or color, the essence of any material or yarn I find. When I discovered this linen I recognized its beauty immediately, and as I work with it I appreciate its virtues more and more: its luster, easy care, stability, strength, straight grain, and wonderful texture.

        <h2 class="title">precision sewing</h2>
        <p>I cut to the thread for accuracy and fold the fabric as precisely as origami before sewing so our minimal seaming is exact.</p>
        <p>Gutermann thread, YKK invisible zippers, French linen tapes and the simplest two-hole, straight-sided buttons – but the search and the temptation goes on. I commissioned a finer textured wide linen sheeting for sheets, pillow slips and lighter duvets, tablecloths and curtains. I couldn’t resist the sheer airiness of open-weave Myriad curtains. Lately I added rich, urbane colors to my beloved classic neutrals – black, gray, indigo. Fabric samples are freely available, just ask.
