        <p>Orkney natural 100% linen is the cornerstone of Rough Linen. It has the traditional texture and color of homespun domestic European linen – I suspect the mill I use has very old looms for I haven't found this exact texture anywhere else. It is the strongest linen I use, for duvet covers, bedspreads, bedskirts, shams, tablecloths, napkins and curtains.</p>

        <h2 class="title">st barts</h2>
        <p>St Barts 100% linen is middleweight and comes in blue, mix (natural and white interwoven), white and various unpredictable colors, so I use it mostly for custom work, in particular the broadly striped, subtly nautical curtains and duvets which have proved such a hit. Let me know what colors you want to see and I will send you samples &#8212; because it changes all the time.</p>

        <h2 class="title">smooth</h2>
        <p>My pure Belgian 100% linen sheeting comes in two colors, natural, and white, which harmonize perfectly with the original, heavier Orkney fabric, both natural and white. I have it woven to my specification to be the quality and heft equivalent to brands costing twice as much. Don't compare this with even high-end chain store linen &#8212; this is better. Sheeting is close-woven and smooth in texture, in contrast to the 'rough' of rustic Orkney which resembles traditional homespun. Its double width makes it suitable for <a href="rough-linen-sheet.html">sheets</a> (no one wants a seam in a sheet!) but its finer weave and smoothness are also well suited for pillowslips, napkins and tablecloths, especially when the two textures are in contrast.

        <p>These sheer, almost weightless curtain panels are made from an off-white, open-weave pure 100% linen 66" wide – shrinks to 64" after washing. I like to allow one 64" panel per 36" of window or only a little less, to be on the generous side, as the fabric is so light and airy. I always recommend ring-clips not only to be able to draw the curtains easily, but length can be adjusted by folding the top over if necessary. My suggested drop is 96" but I can make any length.
