Once again the best idea has come from an architect - thank you Dan! We have started making coverlets - perfectly plain, lightly padded double-sided linen blankets, not only throw size but queen and king too, to use on your summer bed when you feel like just a little extra comfort.  They are a natural follow-on from our patchwork quilts, which are so cosy and light they inspired us to create their contemporary counterparts, for the minimalist in you.

Use them with a Summer Cover, or a top sheet or no top sheet, just as you like.  The subtle sheen of linen, a little extra warmth and the most self-effacing + shaped tufting, very elegant.
