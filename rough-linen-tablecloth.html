            <p class="clearBoth">The charm of Orkney is its texture, which comes from the old looms, whose maximum width is 58". The advantage of the more finely woven Smooth linen is its 118" width, so it makes a flowing, full tablecloth for virtually any size table.</p>
            <p>Both are simple and elegant. Orkney always has deep hems, Smooth Linen can also come with the raw edge much loved by stylists, and a pintuck 3" in. Layer the two fabrics for extra finish, the smooth undercloth longer than the textured overcloth by 3" to 5" all round.</p>
            <p>Tables vary in width and length, but the drop should not be less than 8", and generally not more than 15"– a practical length, as it is too short to sit on! 10" to 12" is usual.</p>
            <p>For wider tables and rounds I can extend Orkney by seaming in quadrants, far smarter and more tailored than side panels – think of a hot cross bun. Round tablecloths have a stabilized raw edge rather than a hem. </p>

        <p><em>"Dear Tricia and team, I SO LOVE my new linen! I read your website carefully before purchasing and felt I was making an informed decision. But it was all way BETTER than expected. The hand wrapped and ribboned parcels were just delightful (and it takes A LOT for me to be thrilled about packaging)  and the linen itself &#8212; AMAZING! My new tablecloth was instantly on the table. Much to my happiness it was a perfect fit! No more adjusting and making do with store bought, inappropriately sized tablecloths. What I really love is the texture and colour of the orkney &#8212; natural and soothing. Just perfect for my family life."</em>

            <p>Width is the problem: most fabrics are 60”, so tables wider than 40” need a seamed tablecloth. My seams are invisible &#8212; well almost. My maximum width is 110”, the length is infinite. These large Orkney tablecloths are custom made to size, email me your table’s dimensions.</p>

            <p><em>"Tricia&hellip;I have spent (wasted) a lot of money on tablecloths until I purchased this incredible Orkney Linen Tablecloth from you. It has the most amazing feel and drape.  I cannot wait to have Thanksgiving dinner and show off my tablecloth. Heck with the food. I will be adding the tablecloth that layers underneath next. Thanks for making such beautiful pieces."</em> – <strong>Lisa</strong></p>
